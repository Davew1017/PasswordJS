# PasswordJS
This application generates a random password based upon specified user criteria (length of password, and selection of at least one more more of the following: upper case letters, lower case letters, numbers, and/or special characters).
HTML 5 was used for the structure of the application.
The range slider was created using input type="range">.
Storing values was used with <datalist> and <option> tags.
Checkboxes were created using <input> and <label> tags.
Buttons were created for generating passwords and one to copy the password.
Element values were retrieved using document.getElementById.
If/else conditions were created dependent on checkbox and password strength.
A for loop was used to create password characters randomly.
